== Introduction

Variables in JavaScript are containers used to store **data values**. You can think of them like labeled jars that hold information you might want to reuse later.

== Declaring Variables

There are three primary ways to declare variables:

[source, javascript]
----
var name = "Alice";     // Oldest way
let age = 25;           // Modern, block-scoped
const PI = 3.14;        // Constant, cannot be reassigned
----

=== 1. `var`
- Function-scoped
- Can be redeclared and updated
- Hoisted (but not initialized)

_Example:_
[source, javascript]
----
function greet() {
    var message = "Hello!";
    console.log(message);
}
----

=== 2. `let`
- Block-scoped (only accessible within the block it's defined)
- Can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope

[source, javascript]
----
let name = "John";
name = "Jane"; // ✅ allowed
let name = "Doe"; // ❌ SyntaxError in same scope
----

=== 3. `const`
- Block-scoped
- Must be initialized at declaration
- Cannot be reassigned (but objects/arrays can still be mutated)

[source, javascript]
----
const score = 100;
score = 200; // ❌ Error
----

[source, javascript]
----
const user = { name: "Alex" };
user.name = "Jordan"; // ✅ allowed (object properties can change)
----

== Hoisting

JavaScript "hoists" `var` declarations to the top of their scope, but not their values.

[source, javascript]
----
console.log(greeting); // undefined
var greeting = "Hi";
----

With `let` or `const`, accessing before declaration throws a ReferenceError:

[source, javascript]
----
console.log(name); // ❌ ReferenceError
let name = "Leo";
----

== Naming Rules and Conventions

- Names must begin with a letter, `$`, or `_`
- Cannot start with a number
- Case-sensitive (`myVar` ≠ `myvar`)
- Use `camelCase` for readability

== Real-World Example

Suppose you're building a shopping cart. You might write:

[source, javascript]
----
let totalPrice = 0;
const taxRate = 0.18;

function addItem(price) {
    totalPrice += price * (1 + taxRate);
}
----

== Summary

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Keyword | Characteristics
| var | Function-scoped, can be redeclared
| let | Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared
| const | Block-scoped, must be assigned and cannot be reassigned
|===

Use `let` and `const` in modern JS. Reserve `var` only for legacy code.
